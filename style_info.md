#Styleboard Descriptions

##Style-1
---
For this style I was very influenced by native north american culture. I chose hues/shades of blue because of the owls often respresented in that culture with dark blues, connecting it to the night and cold.
This style is very clean and clear with subtle hints of texture. The pros to this style would be that it is easy to navigate. It's very simple and straight-forward. The native influence can hint at the cultural aspect of the site while also keeping a more strict modern look for things like facts.

##Style-2
---
Style #2 was inspired by the eyes of the Northern White-Faced Owl which appear orange, almost red. Not only the eyes but the owl itself inspired the colour scheme. All white with spots of red, orange and dark greys. This one has more of an encyclopedia type of look. It's more informative and less colorful. The pros to this would be that people could take it more seriously and continue to search the site for valuable information. The cons could be that it simply looks too serious and people may get bored of it.

##Style-3
---
This one is different from the others as it is geared toward a younger audience. Green is a fun, bright and energetic colour. I want to make it something fun to look at. All in all, family friendly. I used a nice large handwritten script font for headers to decorate it a little. Pros to this would be that it's a more interactive style. More things happen with you hover over links, there are more images, there's always something to look at. Cons would be that perhaps it looks too crowded, and unattractive. Might not take it seriously.
