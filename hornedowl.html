 <h1>The Great Horned Owl</h1>
	<p><strong>The Great Horned Owls</strong> is a very large, powerful owl with prominent ear-tufts. It was first seen in the Virginia colonies, so its species name "virginianus" was created from the Latinised form of this name. Great Horned Owls are sometimes known as Hoot Owls, Cat Owls or Winged Tigers.</p>
    <p>The facial disc is rusty-brown to ochre-buff, paler around the eyes, with a prominent blackish rim on each side. Eyes are yellow, with blackish edged eyelids. The bill and cere are greyish. Eyebrows are prominent and whitish. Ear-tufts are long and tousled.
The upperparts are warm brownish-buff, mottled and vermiculated with greyish-brown, black and whitish. The crown is similar in colouration to the mantle, but finely barred dark and light. The outer webs of the scapulars have large whitish areas, irregularly marked with a few dark transverse bars. There is a row of whitish spots across the shoulder which is not very obvious. Flight and tail feathers are distinctly barred dark and light. The outer webs of the primaries are brownish-buff, while the inner webs are much paler.
The underparts are brownish-buff, becoming paler towards the belly. The throat is whitish and very prominent when inflated during calling. The upper breast has blackish blotches and some cross-bars, and the rest of the underparts are coarsely barred light and dark.
Tarsi and toes are densely feathered, with just a small zone at the end of the toes bare, and coloured greyish-brown. Claws are dark horn with blackish tips.
General colouration varies individually.</p>
