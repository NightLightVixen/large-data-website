- He clicked on the first link as expected
- He had no trouble completing the tasks
- he didn't do much other than fiddle around with the pointer before clicking on the link

- He asked me what physiology was. A few words later he completed task 2.
- Completed task 3 just fine

### Chantal Charbonneau
