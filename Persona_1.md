##Description
---
Idina is a middle aged woman who teaches a class of energetic 6th graders. She's very passionate about teaching and loves her class. She's the teacher everyone wishes they had, who makes all her lessons fun to keep her students interested. She's very patient, open minded and artistic. She is all around a very colourful individual with a lot of personality and a love of learning on school time and her own time. Although it may seem so, she's not one to ramble on and veer off the subject. She's very 'to the point' and doesn't beat around the bush.


##Technology Skills
---

She likes to keep up with her students and what they know about technology. She can manage herself very well on a computer, knowing the basics, how to search and surf the web, but she's much more adept to her iphone with which her students are often very helpful with, teaching her new things.


##What She Likes
---

Idina has a very open personality and thus has a wide variety of things that she likes and enjoys. The simplest things appeal to her the most, such as lounging in her sunroom with her dog, amidst all her flowers and plants with a cup of pekoe tea and some good music while she works. Or cleaning out her aviary and spending time with her finches and sometimes indulging in a delicious nutella sandwich. She'd rather not stress over anything.


##What She Dislikes
---

She doesn't like feeling manipulated or given false information and she doesn't like being pestered to change her mind. She doesn't like putting things off for later, when she decides to do something it's then and there. She'd rather not deal with anything overly complicated, it ruins the experience for her.


##What would help this person? 
---

As a teacher, such information could come in useful should they ever happen upon the subject with her students. Considering how she loves to learn on her own time at home, she could simply read up on it for fun. A little more knowledge never hurt anyone. She also has her own aviary outside, filled with small finches, so knowing a little more about bigger birds of prey could be handy if they needed extra protection or if something were to happen.
