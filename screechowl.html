  <h1>The Western Screech Owl</h1>
	<p><strong>The Western Screech Owl</strong> is a small, nocturnal woodland Owl with short ear-tufts and yellow eyes. A grey and a less common brown morph are known to exist. The species name "kennicotti" was created to honour Robert Kennicott, an American explorer and naturalist (1835-1866). Originally, this bird was officially called "Kennicott's Owl". Common names include <i>Little Horned Owl, Dusk Owl, Ghost Owl, Mouse Owl, Cat Owl, Little Cat Owl, Puget Sound Screech Owl, Washington Screech Owl, and Coastal Screech Owl.</i></p>
    <p><strong>Grey morph:</strong> The facial disc is pale brownish-grey, finely mottled and vermiculated darker. The rim is dark and not very prominent, with pale speckles on the edge. The eyebrows are slightly paler than the surrounding plumage, so are not very prominent. The eyes are bright yellow, the bill and cere blackish. There are blackish bristles at the base of the bill. Ear-tufts are short and pointed, and prominent when erected. 
The crown and upperparts are brownish-grey with blackish shaft-streaks and fine vermiculations. The scapulars have whitish outer webs, edged black, forming a line of white spots across each shoulder. Flight feathers are boldly barred light and dark, while the tail is less distinctly barred.
Underparts are paler than the upperparts, with blackish shaft-streaks and irregular cross-barring. The upper breast has some broad shaft-streaks resembling black spots.
Tarsi are feathered to the base of the toes, which are greyish-brown in colour and bristled and partly feathered. Claws are blackish-horn.
<strong>Brown morph:</strong> Similar in pattern but with a more rufous-brown general colouration.
